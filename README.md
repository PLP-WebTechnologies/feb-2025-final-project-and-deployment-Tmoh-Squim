Okay, here's a real-world documentation example you can add to your GitHub repository for your static e-commerce website hosted on GitHub Pages, featuring "add to cart" and "view cart" functionalities. This documentation is typically added as a `README.md` file in the root of your repository.

# Static E-commerce Website

[![GitHub Pages](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME)

## Overview

This is a simple, static e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and view the contents of their cart. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Key Features:**

* **Product Catalog:** Displays a list of available products with details like name, price, and image.
* **Add to Cart:** Users can easily add products to their virtual shopping cart.
* **View Cart:** A dedicated page to view the items added to the cart, including quantities and the total price.
* **Local Storage:** The shopping cart data is persisted locally using the browser's `localStorage`.
* **Static Content:** The website is built with static files, making it fast and easy to deploy on platforms like GitHub Pages.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For structuring the website content.
* **CSS:** For styling the website and making it visually appealing.
* **JavaScript:** For implementing the interactive features like adding to cart and managing the shopping cart.

## Setup and Deployment

This website is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. Here's how to set it up:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/PLP-WebTechnologies/feb-2025-final-project-and-deployment-Tmoh-Squim.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Ensure Correct File Structure:** Verify that your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are organized as shown in the "File Structure" section.

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    * Go to your repository on GitHub.
    * Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    * Under the **Source** section, select **Branch: main** (or your main branch name) and choose the `/ (root)` directory.
    * Click **Save**.

4.  **Access Your Website:** Your website will be live at `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME`. It might take a few minutes for the changes to propagate.

## Functionality Details

### Adding to Cart

* On the product listing or product detail pages, users will find an "Add to Cart" button (or similar).
* When a user clicks this button, the JavaScript code in `js/script.js` (or a related file) will:
    * Identify the unique product ID of the item being added.
    * Store this product ID (and potentially the quantity) in the browser's `localStorage` under a specific key (e.g., `'cartItems'`).
    * Provide visual feedback to the user that the item has been added (e.g., a notification or a change in a cart icon).

    ```javascript
    // Example (simplified) from js/script.js
    function addToCart(productId) {
      let cart = localStorage.getItem('cartItems');
      cart = cart ? JSON.parse(cart) : [];
      cart.push(productId); // Or store as { id: productId, quantity: 1 }
      localStorage.setItem('cartItems', JSON.stringify(cart));
      alert('Product added to cart!');
      updateCartBadge(); // Function to update a cart icon if present
    }
    ```

### Viewing the Cart

* The `cart.html` page displays the items that the user has added to their cart.
* The JavaScript code in `js/cart.js` (or `js/script.js`) will:
    * Retrieve the cart data from `localStorage` using the same key used when adding items.
    * Parse the JSON data to get the list of product IDs (and quantities, if stored).
    * (Optionally) Fetch product details (name, price, image) based on these IDs. This might involve:
        * Looking up data from a JavaScript array or object defined within the script.
        * Reading from a `products.json` file (if implemented).
    * Dynamically generate the HTML elements to display each item in the cart, including its name, quantity, and price.
    * Calculate and display the total price of all items in the cart.
    * Provide functionality to update quantities or remove items from the cart (which would also update `localStorage`).

    ```javascript
    // Example (simplified) from js/cart.js
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
      const cartItems = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cartItems')) || [];
      const cartContainer = document.getElementById('cart-items-container');
      let totalPrice = 0;

      if (cartItems.length > 0) {
        // Assuming you have a way to get product details by ID
        cartItems.forEach(productId => {
          const product = getProductDetails(productId); // Replace with your actual logic
          if (product) {
            const cartItemDiv = document.createElement('div');
            cartItemDiv.textContent = `${product.name} - $${product.price}`;
            cartContainer.appendChild(cartItemDiv);
            totalPrice += product.price; // Assuming quantity is 1 for simplicity
          }
        });
        document.getElementById('cart-total').textContent = `Total: $${totalPrice.toFixed(2)}`;
      } else {
        cartContainer.textContent = 'Your cart is empty.';
      }
    });
    ```
